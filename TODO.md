# TODO

A lot, but start with these first.


## FIX

- fix table types (silver-txn = binary, silver-profiles = binary)

    Using NiFi, it is ok. Happybase auth not working.

- pyspark in Notebook (UA) to access silver tables


## NICE TO HAVE

- enrich dashboard, customer info

    - add silver tables for data scientists/analysts

- complete ~~NiFi~~ / Airflow for continious flow

- move gold table to delta -> connect to superset

- apply cdc logs for fraud detection

- integrate with Open Metadata

- integrate with MS EntraID
