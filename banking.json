  "description": "In this demo we will be looking at the stream processing capabilities of Ezmeral Data Fabric for an end to end fraud detection pipeline. We will be using various utilities, such as REST API and Python mapr-stream and maprdb libraries to produce and consume transactions. For that, we would like to capture these messages as they arrive, process and apply our ML model to detect if that specific transaction is fradualent or not.  \n\nWe will be using Data Fabric Event Store pub/sub mechanism to submit transaction data into a topic, and another app/process that is consuming these transaction messages and generating a transaction profile and put this profile into Data Fabric Binary Table for quick referral. Finally the microservice that is checking all previous and related transactions with the profile placed in this table will respond to our app via topic creating a bi-directional messaging pipeline. \n\nOur pipeline here supports Ezmeral Data Fabric converged platform to store and serve data in both streaming and operational database engines.",
