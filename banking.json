  "description": "Here we would like to process transaction messages coming from different sources to detect fraud. For that, we would like to capture these messages as they arrive, process and apply our ML model to detect if that specific transaction is fradualent or not.  \n\nWe will be using Data Fabric Event Store pub/sub mechanism to submit transaction data into a topic, and another app/process that is consuming these transaction messages and generating a transaction profile and put this profile into Data Fabric Binary Table for quick referral. Finally the microservice that is checking all previous and related transactions with the profile placed in this table will respond to our app via topic creating a bi-directional messaging pipeline. \n\nOur pipeline here supports Ezmeral Data Fabric converged platform to store and serve data in both streaming and operational database engines.",

For low-latency access, we will use certain fields in the messages and push them into a JSON DocumentDB so our ML model can perform fast querying with filters and selects for specific accounts and timeframes, rather than trying to read all messages or transactions. \n\nIn a real-world scenario, we would run this process as a service across multiple instances to increase the throughput and reduce processing/response times.
